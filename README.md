## Overview 
A week back, I wrote an article on [How to Get into Data Science in 2021](https://jasmcaus.medium.com) and since then I've received several emails from people all over the world asking ***just how much*** math is required in Data Science. 

I won't lie: It's **a lot of math**. 

And this is one of the reasons that puts off many beginners. After much research and talks with several veterans in the field, I've compiled this no-nonsense guide that covers **all of the fundamentals of the math you'll need to know**. The concepts mentioned below are usually covered over several semesters in college, but I've boiled them down to the core principles that you can focus on. 

This guide is an absolute life-saver for beginners, so you can study the topics that matter most, and an even better resource for practitioners such as myself who require a quick breeze-through on these concepts.
